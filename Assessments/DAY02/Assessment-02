Ans 1:
Method used: Type Casting + Rounding
Explanation: Student Attendance & Eligibility
•	Attendance is stored as int because it represents whole numbers.
•	Percentage is calculated using double to preserve decimal accuracy.
•	Rounding is used before converting to int to avoid wrong eligibility results.
Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int netClasses = 180;
            int attendedClasses = 152;
            double percentage = (attendedClasses * 100.0) / netClasses;
            // For display
            int rounded = (int)Math.Round(percentage);   // recommended
            int truncated = (int)percentage;             // not recommended
        }
    }
}

Ans 2:
Method used: Explicit Casting
Explanation: Online Examination Result Processing
•	Marks are stored as int since exam scores are whole values.
•	Average is calculated in double to maintain precision.
•	Rounding is applied before converting to int to reduce precision loss.
Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
	int[] marks = { 78, 82, 91 };
double avg = marks.Average();
double roundedDecimals = Math.Round(avg, 2);
int scholarshipScore = (int)Math.Round(avg);
    }
}

Ans 3:
Method used: Explicit Casting
Explanation 3: Library Fine Calculation System
•	decimal is used for fine calculation to ensure accurate money values.
•	Days overdue are stored as int because they are count-based.
•	Fine is converted to double only for analytics purposes.

namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            decimal finePerDay = 2.50m;
            int daysLate = 6;
            decimal totalFine = finePerDay * daysLate;
            double analyticsValue = (double)totalFine;
        }
    }
}

Ans 4: 
Method used: Explicit Casting
Explanation 4: Banking Interest Calculation Module
•	Account balance is stored as decimal for financial accuracy.
•	Interest rate is received as float from an external API.
•	Explicit conversion to decimal is required for safe calculations.
Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            decimal balance = 100000m;
            float rate = 7.5f;
            // explicit conversion required
            decimal interest = balance * (decimal)rate / 100;
            balance += interest;
        }
    }
}

Ans 5:
Method used: Type Conversion
Explanation 5: E-Commerce Order Pricing Engine
•	Cart total is accumulated using double due to multiple calculations.
•	Tax and discount are handled using decimal to avoid rounding errors.
•	Final payable amount is stored as decimal for precision.
Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            double cartTotal = 3499.99;
            decimal tax = 0.18m;
            decimal discount = 0.10m;
            decimal finalAmount =
                (decimal)cartTotal * (1 + tax - discount);
        }
    }
}
Ans 6:
Method used: Type Casting
Exercise 6: Weather Monitoring & Reporting
•	Sensor readings are stored as short to save memory.
•	Values are converted to double for accurate temperature calculation.
•	Result is rounded and converted to int for dashboard display.

Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            short raw = 325; // example
            double celsius = raw / 10.0;

            int displayTemp = (int)Math.Round(celsius);
        }
    }
}


Ans 7:
Method used: Conditional Casting
Explanation: University Grading Engine
•	Final score is calculated as double to include fractional marks.
•	Grades are stored as byte because of their limited range.
•	Conditional checks ensure safe and valid grade assignment.
Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            double score = 87.4;
            byte grade;

            if (score >= 90) grade = 10;
            else if (score >= 80) grade = 9;
            else if (score >= 70) grade = 8;
            else grade = 0;
        }

}


Ans 8:
Method used: Implicit Conversion + Rounding
Explanation: Mobile Data Usage Tracker
•	Data usage is stored as long to support large values.
•	Conversion to double allows MB and GB calculations.
•	Rounding is used before converting to int for summary display.


Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            long bytes = 5368709120; // 5 GB
            double gb = bytes / (1024.0 * 1024 * 1024);
            int roundedGB = (int)Math.Round(gb);
        }
    }
}


Ans 9:
Metho
d used: Type Promotion (Implicit Comparison)
Explanation: Warehouse Inventory Capacity Control
•	Item count uses int while maximum capacity uses ushort.
•	Direct comparison avoids unsafe type casting.
•	This prevents overflow and signed/unsigned conversion issues.
Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int items = 65000;
            ushort maxCapacity = 60000;

            bool exceeded = items > maxCapacity;
        }
    }
}
Ans 10
Method used: Explicit Casting
Explanation: Payroll Salary Computation
•	Basic salary is stored as int because it is a fixed amount.
•	Allowances and deductions use double due to decimal values.
•	Net salary is stored as decimal to ensure financial accuracy.

Code:
namespace ConsoleApp2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int basic = 40000;
            double allowance = 5500.75;
            double deduction = 1200.25;

            decimal netSalary =
                basic + (decimal)allowance - (decimal)deduction;
        }
    }
}
